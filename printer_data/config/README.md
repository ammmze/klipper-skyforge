# Skyforge

Skyforge is my Voron 2.4r2 350mm. It was built from a Formbot kit and contains the following:

* CANBus toolhead
  * Filametrix
  * TZ 2.0 v6
  * EBB SB2209 RP2040
  * Cartographer v3 w/ ADXL
* Fysetc Blobifier kit
* [THE Filter](https://www.printables.com/model/334276-the-filter-for-voron-24)
* BoxTurtle
  * AFC Lite 1.0 (connected via CANBus...but need to switch to USB...dangerous having it on the same bus as the Cartographer...it killed one already)
